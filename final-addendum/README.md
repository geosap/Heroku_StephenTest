## The Project

Our project group decided to take a look at how to create the shortest path on a telecom network. Our idea was to look at a few different ways to teach a machine to look at the shortest path and to compare them.
We used
1. A library Shahzad wrote using a text book and some research
2. The second one was using Scikit
